## Description

E-Tinga is a project that employs modern technology channels to allow farmers access farm mechanization. One of these being its online-based platforms that enable farmers to order for services as groups or individuals using hand gadgets such as mobile phones, tablets,s or computers. This accessibility enables even small-scale farmers to enjoy farming equipment on short-term leases. Etinga Community Model Concept works by allowing farmers to register for mechanization services as groups through already established units such as NGOs, Chama, SACCO, Co-operative Societies, or Churches.
